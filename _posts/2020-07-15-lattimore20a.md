title: Exploration by Optimisation in Partial Monitoring
abstract: " We provide a novel algorithm for adversarial k-action d-outcome partial
  monitoring that is adaptive, intuitive and efficient. The highlight is that for
  the non-degenerate locally observable games, the n-round minimax regret is bounded
  by 6m k^(3/2) sqrt(n log(k)), where m is the number of signals. This matches the
  best known information-theoretic upper bound derived via Bayesian minimax duality.
  The same algorithm also achieves near-optimal regret for full information, bandit
  and globally observable games. High probability bounds and simple experiments are
  also provided."
